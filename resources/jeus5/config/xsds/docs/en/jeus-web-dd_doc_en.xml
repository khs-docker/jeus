                                        This way, session tracking will work even if different domain names are used across several calls. This will cause all the URL's returned by the context to have a unique

                        [Description]: This element configures the caching of static resources such as images and HTML files. 
										Caching means that often-requested files are temporarily stored and fetched from main memory instead of from the secondary storage (e.g. the hard disc drive). 
                                        This will increase the performance of fetching such static resources.
